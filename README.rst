Template123
===========

This is a template for projects which use

   Testing123 --> BootsOnTheGround --> TriBITS --> CMake

Yes, it is a deep heirarchy.

- Testing123 gives us a unit testing framework in C++ and Fortran.
- BootsOnTheGround gives us third-party library (TPL) management,
  including on-the-fly downloads.
- TriBITS gives us project dependency management and best-practice macros.
- CMake gives us cross-platform (Windows/Linux/Mac) compatibility.

Let's go through the project in the order it is processed by CMake [*]_. 

.. [*] These sections may be regenerated by running the script in `Regeneration Script`_.
